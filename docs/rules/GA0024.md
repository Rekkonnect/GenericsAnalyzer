# GA0024

## Title
Type constaint profile group type also implements other behavior

## Category
Design

## Severity
Warning

## Details
This warning is emitted when an interface type assigned as a type constraint profile group contains non-static members. It should be generally avoided to also use type constraint profile group interfaces for behavior implementation.

## Example
```csharp
[TypeConstraintProfileGroup]
interface A
{
    // GA0024 will NOT appear here, since a constant is a static member
    public const int Constant = 3;

    // GA0024 will NOT appear here, the function is static
    public static void Function() { }

    // GA0024 will appear here
    public int Property { get; }
}
```

## Remarks
This warning only applies to type constraint profile group interfaces and not type constraint profile ones, since a future feature will make use of any interface members being implemented.
