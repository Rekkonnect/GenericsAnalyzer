# GA0024

## Title
Type constaint profile type also implements other behavior

## Category
Design

## Severity
Warning

## Details
This warning is emitted when an interface type assigned as a type constraint profile (group) contains non-static members. It should be generally avoided to also use type constraint profile (group) interfaces for behavior implementation.

## Example
```csharp
[TypeConstraintProfile]
interface A
{
    // GA0024 will NOT appear here, since a constant is a static member
    public const int Constant = 3;

    // GA0024 will NOT appear here, the function is static
    public static void Function() { }

    // GA0024 will appear here
    public int Property { get; }
}
```
