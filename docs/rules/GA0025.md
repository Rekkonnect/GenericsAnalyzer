# GA0025

## Title
Mixed type constraint profile interfaces with irrelevant ones in inheritance

## Category
Design

## Severity
Warning

## Details
This warning is emitted when an interface type that is not assigned as a type constraint profile (group) inherits another interface that is assigned as such, or vice versa. It should be generally avoided to mix type constraint profile (group) interfaces with unrelated ones.

## Example
```csharp
[TypeConstraintProfile]
interface IProfile { }

// GA0025 will appear here
interface IUnrelated : IProfile { }

// GA0025 will appear here
[TypeConstraintProfile]
interface IProfile1 : IUnrelated { }
```
